# liftover
A tool to convert genome coordinates and genome annotation files between assemblies.
Underneath, ut uses the fantastic [`rtracklayer`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/rtracklayer.html) package from Bioconductor, and the [chain files](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html#liftover) supplied by UCSC.
